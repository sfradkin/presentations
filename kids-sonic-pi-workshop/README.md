# Kids Sonic Pi workshop

These are materials for a 3 hour kids Sonic Pi workshop.  A really rough outline
is shared that forms the basis of a workshop.  The six Ruby files are examples that
are used as part of the workshop.

In the songs directory are examples of songs that kids have done in one of my
workshops.
