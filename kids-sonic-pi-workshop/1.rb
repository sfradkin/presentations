# Hi! Welcome to the Sonic Pi Workshop!
# Download Sonic Pi at http://sonic-pi.net

# A bit of housekeeping...
# I'll show you how do program some things in
# Sonic Pi,
# then you'll get time to practice what you
# just learned.

# We'll take a longer break about halfway
# through for a snack.

# If you like what you do today, we can record
# your music and
# save your code and I'll put it up on my
# website anonymously.

# Ready? Let's make some music!
