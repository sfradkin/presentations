# Intro to Music Synthesis with Tone.js

This is an introduction to using Tone.js

The tone.html file in this repository contains the pieces of the demo for the presentation.

Please see [my clone of Snap!](https://github.com/sfradkin/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks) to see the initial Tone.js integration I showed during the presentation.
